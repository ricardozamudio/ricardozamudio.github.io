			Our Senior Design group had the unique opportunity to work the the University of Iowa football program (following their 12-0 regular season!) to develop a web application tailored to streamline gameplan studying and communication amongst a football team.  The Playbook had three types of users: admins, players, and coaches.  Admins were in charge of creating player and coach profiles.  Coaches were able to draw up new plays using an HTML5 canvas and play template system, edit weekly gameplans in an embedded Google Sheet, and send notices and updates to their players.  Players could login, either on a laptop or mobile device and view the week's gameplan, browse the playbook, and view player assignments and/or embedded footage for any specific play.  With guidance from several members of the Iowa defensive coaching staff, we created a project with the potential to expand to other sports and serve as a new team communication system.

			The Pick 'Em web application was a semester group project for an introductory Ruby on Rails course.  With football season in full swing, and us being a group of sports fans, this was a fun application of our new knowledge of Rails and RESTful APIs.  Users could register, create Pick 'Em leagues, and invite their friends to register and join their
			league via email.  League commissioners could customize how many games were to be picked, and from which FBS conference.  Each week, FBS matchups and spreads were pulled via the Pinnacle Sports API.  Users could then log in and pick games against the spread.  Upon week completion, score data was pulled and results were tallied.  Bragging rights went to the weekly and season winners!

			In the Internet of Things course at the University of Iowa, our projects focused on the IoT in the realm of healthcare.  Excessive heat is known to lead to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, or even a heart attack.  This project was a prototype Arduino-controlled wearable device with heart rate and temperature/humidity sensors, coupled with a simple Android application which together monitored the user's heart rate and the ambient heat index.  Given the user's age, the system alerted the user to dangerous combinations of heart rate and heat index.  If the user did not respond to three of these notices, a call was placed to the user's designated emergency contact.  The user's real-time data was sent to a Firebase cloud-based database.  While the scope of this project limited us to the danger index for a 50-year-old male, and no analysis was performed on archived data, with further effort this system could look for trends in aggregated data and tailor alerts to users based on genetic and conditional factors.  Our prototype was selected to be presented at the University of Iowa  2016 Modern Marvels Exhibition, along with Senior Design projects.

			For our semester project in an introductory embedded systems class, my partner and I designed a simple instrument using an ATMega328P microcontroller, a motion sensor, a tone buzzer, and an LED display.  Drawing from the idea of a theremin, the user could contol the buzzer's pitch by moving their hand towards or away from the motion sensor.  The LEDs, mounted at the incremental tone distances from the sensor, indicated which note the user was playing.  The user select their scale of choice with a push-button, and this data, along with the note currently being played, was shown on a small LED display. In true college student fashion, we wired and mounted the LED display on a strip cut from a pizza box.  This project was selected to be presented at the University of 2015 Iowa Modern Marvels exhibition, along with Senior Design projects.
