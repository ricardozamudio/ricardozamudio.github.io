	<h1>Thanks for stopping by!</h1>
	<p>My name's Ricardo Zamudio - my friends call me Rick, in some cases Ricky, but I'll answer to any of those! I am a recent grad software engineer, just getting my feet set in the working world and looking to build a career.  I am interested in full-stack development of user-facing applications, particularly Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET GUIs, Django, and the like.</p>
	<p>I graduated from the University of Iowa in May 2016 with a bachelor's in electrical &amp; computer engineering (software focus) and minors in math, business, and computer science.  Some overviews of my college projects are <a href="#">here</a>.  During my time in college, I gained valuable internship experience with user-facing applications at State Farm and Rockwell Collins.  During the school year, I worked for UI Engineering Computer Services.  I was an officer in the UI Tennis Club and in Sigma Lambda Beta Fraternity's Alpha Chapter.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about sports and fitness, and geek out about music.  My favorite weekends are spent at Hawkeye games, music festivals, on the tennis court, or in the gym.  On this site I'll be sharing thoughts about these interests, as well as projects and professional pursuits.</p>
